## Polr Libraries
-----------------------

To interact with Polr's API, you may opt to use a library or write your own integration.
As not all languages and frameworks are currently supported by a library, it is encouraged
that you take a look at the [API documentation](api/) to integrate Polr into your application.

### Official Libraries
- there are no official libraries for Polr 2.0 yet.

### Unofficial libraries

- perhaps you'd like to write one? Send a PR to add your library to this page.
